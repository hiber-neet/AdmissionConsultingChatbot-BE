PLACEHOLDER FILE
================

This is a placeholder file created automatically because the original file
uploaded from another developer's machine is not available locally.

Document Title: aa
Original Path: uploads/6520d5b6-e2ec-4f15-b4b7-2b2bf43d49a4_sqlScript.txt

To get the actual file:
1. Ask your team member who uploaded it to share it
2. Set up a shared storage system (e.g., Git LFS, AWS S3, Google Drive)
3. Or sync the uploads/ folder across all development machines

This placeholder allows the application to continue working without errors.
